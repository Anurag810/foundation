## Standard Operating Procedures(Quality Procedure):

 A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organisation to help workers carry out complex routine operations. SOPs aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing miscommunication and failure to comply with industry regulations.

 You can create Quality Procedures related to or unrelated to a particular Department. Everything revolve around the Quality Procedures, which must be followed for fulfilling Quality Goals.
 
 Every Procedure can be a sub-Procedure for another Root Procedure.

 The Tree structure of the Procedures can be seen in Chart of Procedures.

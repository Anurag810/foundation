# Introduction

## What is an ERP system and why should anyone care to use it?

*If you are already convinced you need an all-in-one system for your
organization, you can skip this page.*

Today, small & medium sized businesses are not so different from large/enterprises. Typically, they too face similar complexities as a large business but have limited resources to deal with such complexity. 

Small businesses (like their bigger counterparts) have to 
- do accounts to keep track of sales/ purchases
- pay taxes to the goverment
- pay their employees
- manage deliveries within promised timelines
- deliver quality goods and services
- communicate with customers, answer queries
And generally try to keep everyone happy.

So far, large enterprises have been able to invest 100s of millions of dollars in very sophisticated systems such as SAP to bring their multi country, multi company, multi currency global businesses online into a single platform to achieve some of the basic process such as accounting, taxation, payroll, reporting, supply chain to name a few.  

Small businesses, on the other hand, typically have been left out of this 1st wave of digital revolution (1995-2015) because they dont have the $ power to license, hire and customize such software to suite their needs. Systems like SAP have been NO-GO for most SMEs with a *minimum* CAPEX or OPEX layout of $100k (100 Thousand Dollars) 

So even today, small businesses continue to struggle to keep things organized. They often use a mix of applications and tools such as spreadsheets, accounting softwares, web based CRMs to manage their day to day record keeping. As a consequence, they have to access different systems to understand customers, sales, cash flow or profitability. The information exists in silos and the data is hard to combine to get useful insights or alerts. As a consequence, small businesses typically are **reactive** instead of being **proactive**. With such a constrained way of working, there is limited scope for **leveraged growth**. Which means, as your business grows, your cost grow in the same proportion. And you have hardly improve your margin.
